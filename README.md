# Objective:
Challenge: 1 with Synthesis with blackbox modules RAM128, RAM256 and POR 
Challenge: 2 GLS

Results  got with normal synthesis but without topographical-based synthesis

# Objective:
Identified with soultion with compile_ultra -incremental The incremental compile also supports adaptive retiming with the compile_ultra -incremental -retime command.

Running the compile_ultra -incremental command on a topographical netlist results in placement-based optimization only. This compile should not be thought of as an incremental mapping. 
Finally the soultion for GLS with adding all the rtl files in gl folder
